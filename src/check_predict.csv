1,1,bought furniture from M-59 store headboard broke before it could get off the truck told replacement between 3-11 now being told tomorrow 62 years old sleeping on the floor Art Van the next time,0
1,1,"I called Gettington on Monday October 18, 2016 and spoke to Steffy to advise my package is being delivered to the wrong address. She told me she would put in a request to reroute the package. The package was not rerouted and was delivered to my old address. I told her that I contacted UPS and they said Gettington could change the delivery address and she did nothing. I have been a customer for years and I will never order anything else from your company. I was told a supervisor would call me and that didn't happen either. You have lost a customer and I will tell everyone I know how I was treated with your company.",0
1,1,horrible customer service. my transaction was cancelled because the shipping and billing address was different. i am moving why would my billing address be the same at that time. used my roomplace charge and the pending charge for an order you cancelled has not dropped off and now i am waiting for days in order to reorder. horrible business,0
1,1,The sale guy come to my house and told me he giving me 30 free try for the system just call him to cancel it’s that easy yeah right before 30 days up I called him multiple time never answer his phone or answer his message called customer servers to cancel with them they saying that I didn’t have the 30 free try and tried to get in contact with the salesman but that man never get back to them either and now they saying I’m stuck with them for 5 years just the door bell and the garage camera 87$ a months is ridiculous so this is completely a scam ,0
1,1,Issues placing order on web site. Awesome store. Terrible web experience,0
1,1,It's bad business to list sale items you don't have readily in stock. To have to wait for weeks is really unacceptable. NFM needs to quickly turn around a growing negative perception regarding timely delivery of goods. Perhaps they have opened too soon post pandemic. GET IT TOGETHER!,0
1,1,"ADVERTISING 7 DAY EXPRESS DELIVERY 
3 WEEKS STILL NO SOFA ",0
1,1,Please add me to the list to sue.....The closed my account after a year and some months... my credit went down alot because of the amount I had with them..... I paid faithfully every month.,0
1,1,Your customer service reps are so rude & they don't speak English!!! I don't know if I'll continue to do business with this company.,0
1,1,This company will lie it's way into your home and promise you the world that they cannot deliver.  The equipment doesn't work more than half of the time. Do not let the sales people even talk to you. I promise you will regret any type of agreement you reach with these scum bags.,0
1,2,You offer free shipping with a promo code on orders over $100. I used this code on a $400 + order and still had to pay shipping!! Good come on but bad business!!!!,1
1,2,"I hope I can change this rating when I see my plants - and the issue I have is not with Bluestone but rather with the shipping.  My plants left Bluestone on May 2.  It is now May 9th, and the plants are still 150 miles from my house.  They have been stuck in the USPS system for a week now.  I can't imagine what they will look like when they finally get to me.  I know USPS would like to blame the coronavirus for this very slow service, but other items that are deemed nonessential get to me in just a couple days so I don't understand why my poor plants have had to stay in USPS custody for so long.  I live about 6 hours from Bluestone...it should not take over a week for the product to get to me.",1
1,2,"Cameras don’t come out of night mode unless you toggle them. 
They bombard you with notifications, emails etc wanting you to refer people.
And their equipment is RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. Like double the cost of what comparable products are. ",1
1,2,"Shipping is ridiculous! But you can get free shipping codes. The thing that is highly irritating to me is that just because I didn't make a purchase for a few months, during a pandemic I might add, they closed my account and reported it to all 3 credit bureaus that ""account closed at credit grantor request"" so the credit bureaus take that as it being closed for non payment and put it as a derogatory mark on my credit. I called Gettington to see if they would please report a different reason since the account was paid off months before they closed it and to find out why they closed it without notification to me before hand. The woman told me they close all accounts that go more than 3 months with no purchase history and that I should have bought something and there is nothing they can do about how it is reported to the credit. I will never do business with this company or any other company that is sponsored by WebBank......I'm fixing to close my Fingerhut account now!!",1
1,2,I hate furniture shopping and it's hella expensive for no reason.,1
1,2,"Please please please exercise caution when you buy furniture from DFS. 
Please become familiar with the negative reviews before you proceed with your purchase. 
We purchased a suite from them and the bottom of the cuddler was ripped. 
It was faulty on delivery. Steve visited our home to repair it. He was great and replaced the ripped felt. 
Then the settee started making loud creaking noises everytime you moved on it. DFS don’t recognise this as a fault. But they sent Steve yet again to repair it. 
When I spoke to DFS Brigg there was nothing wrong with the sofa,a total lie. 
Now we have noticed that there is padding on top of the springs on one side of the sofa. 
Nothing on the other side. 
Numerous phone calls to DFS Brigg. 
We found that they are very careless with the truth. 

Asked the ombudsman to intervene. 
Just heard that they will do nothing as DFS have apparently fulfilled their obligations and repaired the suite. 
In our opinion this is partially correct as
there remains a problem with the sofa. 
Apparently (according to DFS) our furniture was manufactured using staples and glue to fit the frame together. Obviously something had come apart. 
As the repair was to drill and screw parts of the frame together in an attempt to fix the excessive movement which was causing the creaking noises. 

From our point of view the settee should have been replaced.
We bought a new suite. 
We didn’t buy a suite with a  settee that has been modified with holes drilled in it, and screws fitted in it.  All of this just emphasises that the settee was faulty and not fit for purpose. 

In addition. We were told that the settee was too long to be without additional support in the middle. 
So another repair was to install two extra feet front and back at mid length. Another case for the settee being not fit for purpose. 

We now have to decide if we want to take legal action against DFS as the ombudsman is not prepared to hold DFS accountable. 

What should have been a pleasant experience, has now become the worst experience  we have ever had purchasing furniture.

Purchase order is 02ZNK5211
Thank you for your rapid response Lorraine. 
I contacted the number you provided and had a very nice conversation with a pleasant and professional employee at your Glasgow office.
Will update on here in due course. 

04/09/24. Spoke to Dean and had a respectful conversation. DFS will not refund or replace. Repair man visiting on 12/09/24. This settee will not last. Not even a year old and the Springs already starting to wear through the seating cover. Hardly any padding on top of the springs. 
In comparison we had our last settees for 20 years. They were still in very good condition, and a friend of the family asked for them. 
12/09/24
Dean attended today. Not the same Dean as above. Additional padding (on top of the springs) and felt has been ordered for the settee. 
This will be installed at our home when it arrives. Expected delivery in 6 weeks time or less. 
So following yet another repair, if we are still unhappy we will have to go to the small claims court. 
23/09/24. Had a really pleasant conversation with Hailey. DFS attending on 4/10/24 to replace the padding and felt on the sofa.
4/10/24 Gavin arrived and replaced the top and bottom felt. Great guy and really professional. The top felt was laid on top of the old felt to provide additional cushioning against the springs. No additional foam padding was fitted. This is the first time we have been able to look inside the settee. There isn’t much foam padding on top of the springs. Poor quality wood/chipboard frame.  Thank goodness it has a 15 year warranty. I honestly cannot believe it will last 15 years. We will see. 
DFS Brigg management should learn some customer care skills from their repair personnel. ",1
1,2,Wasn’t installed 24 hrs. And front driveway camera was off line. Called support and was on the phone for over an hour running all kind of tests including unplugging and plugging back in. Then getting a ladder to climb up to try and reset it.  Not happen at all . We 78 and 79 years old we do not need ro be climbing up on ladders,1
1,2,"My friend and I were browsing. My friend purchased a patio set and the egg swing.  I decided to also purchased the egg swing but I didn’t want to apply for the credit card, so the sales rep said “we have a program with zero percent apr for the first 3 months” so I said ok that sounds good, I applied and was approved then she said “you just have to put a down payment” I said that’s fine. We went to the front counter, my debit card was charged what I thought she said was the down payment. About a week after I saw the same item cheaper on their website, we came back for price adjustment, unfortunately the ladies up front seemed as if they did not know what they were doing, but finally they finished. Just a few days ago they deducted my second payment, I asked what was my payoff amount to make sure I’ll have the money before the 3 months, but noticed my first payment was not deducted, so here’s where I find out this company is a leasing company and that first charge was not a “down payment” like the sales rep told me, it was the processing fee for using this program. I was upset because the sales rep did not say there was any fees, she said my first charge was a down payment. I’ve bought from Klarna, zero apr for the first 3 months no additional fees, so that’s why I trusted what the sales rep had said. Only because our furniture is too heave we don’t return it and buy somewhere else, but I definitely will NOT recommend them. I know people looking for furniture but how can I recommend a place that I feel lied to me just to get the sale. Very very disappointed, won’t be going to this store ever again. 😌",1
1,2,I was to receive a free vivint sign and have not received it yet and that was over a month ago.,1

1,3,"I originally bought the theater recliner I always wanted. Had setup to be delivered that following Saturday to my new apartment. Didn't see a sofa that would fit in my little space and wasn't really sure what look I wanted to go for. A friend referred me to Ashley's after I told her I went to Rooms to go. So the next day I went and found a sofa and had that setup to be delivered that same following Saturday. I WAS SO EXCITED,  ESPECIALLY because I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SITTING FURNITURE YET OTHER THAN MY BED IN THE BEDROOM WHERE I WAS WAITING SINCE 6:30AM... Sometime around idk 9am I get a message ""Rooms to go driver trying to deliver. I'm like to myself, Okay well I'm here, direct line of sight to door, tv was on but not loud at all since it was still early. So guy must of knocked like a mouse and didn't even bother to call, text, knock again, try a little louder! Make your delivery. Think MCFLY! Someone ORDERED, BOUGHT, PAID FOR, AND SETUP A SOFA TO BE DELIVERED! THE JERK OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THE DELIVERY. INSTEAD HE WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY ""TIME IS MONEY"" HE WASTED THE COMPANY'S GAS, HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER ""ATTEMPT"" TO DELIVER AGAIN WASTING MORE OF THE COMPANY'S GAS; OH AND TIME AND MONEY BECAUSE ROOMS TO GO PAID HIM TO FAIL THE FIRST DELIVERY ""ATTEMPT"" AND AGAIN WOULD HAVE TO PAY HIM TO MAKE ANOTHER ""ATTEMPT"". HE DOESN'T CARE. HE JUST BURNS GAS ALL DAY EVERYDAY ON SOMEONE ELSE'S DOLLAR AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT I BET THE COMPANY'S CEO 51% SHARES THE DRIVER HAS THE NERVE TO BE RUDE TO EVERY CUSTOMER HE DELIVERS TO AND HAS TO SETUP FOR THEM LIKE ME. I READ THE REVIEWS, BUT I gave y'all a chance anyway and y'all proved all those negative reviews right.
So I canceled my order and now to make things worse, Now I have to wait two weeks for my refund. This is the kind of thing that makes people go CRAZY INSANE.
I found this one picture I'm ordering online and says UPS will deliver. I'd rather deal with those jerks than your delivery jerseys.
Thats it Rooms to go, I'm a returning customer from over ten years ago, my Family and I. But now it's time to part ways as I buy this last piece of decor from you; a small fraction of what I was willing and did just spend on a complete 3 piece sofa set at Ashley's.
Could of been your business but never again.",2

1,3,I just purchased 2 appliances online. When checking out I chose the $49 next day delivery option for the dishwasher.  It also wanted an additional $49 for the ice maker to be delivered the next day too.  Why is there two separate delivery charges if they are purchased together and going to the same address?,2

2,1,"Scam I say no way not me senior citizen I may say : On September 12,  2024 I was pick up 11:30am  by a staff of Park Toyota dealership in deland fl. I thought I was going there to get myself a affordable car, being that I am a substitute teacher and I was in need of a use or new car, I was recommend to see Mr.S Lawson, so I thought I meet a red head who was pushing and rushing me to buy a car, I keep asking him to show me a white and small high lifted car, but he ignore my request, I got a my car loan of 20 thousands and I walk out with Chevrlote Trailbrazer that had a funny jerking sound coming from the motor, and it had a string of smell of cirgrette it was unbearable. I am not a smoker, I return that car in three days because the pastor who had recommend me , told to do so, I return and explain to the staff my concerns not only fo the condition of the car but the price tag, They le time know that they were willing to accommodate me, they would do they best to find me a affordable car. This was the problem the  car was 16 thousand and in five years I would pay 35 thousand, does that sound like a good deal for a use car and it had four owner. Then I was introduce to a black saleperson by the name of C.J who file not one car loan but six request of a car loan under my name and my credit score was in the 6 figure and it went down to 5 figure, so now I have a bad credit report that would even help me to buy myself a car or even rent a apartment . I can't believe how this dealership works, take me a senior citizen for a ride and then try to scam me , I had a very bad headache that day and I couldn't read my contractor for sure they were happy about that, but when my head clear, I was in shock to see 21.97 percent and some other fee . I couldn't believe it , I was hanging from a rope and didn't even notice it .Well when they give me the second saleperson he mention something about being black, but in my case that wasn't the reason, I didn't like the first sale person but because he was rushing me pushing me and coercing me to buy now. I was on the phone with Direct auto and the sale person had me for 45 minutes on the phone and then there was commotion during the deal. it just add up that this dealership has a habit of taking senior citizen for a ride to the hang me if you can scam. I couldn't believe the price I would have to pay for a use car, no! Now the ripple effect my sister who much lighter then me had gone there and got a small new small car, I am dark skin, could this be the reason I wasn't treated with respect and courtesy . The second saleperson mention the color of my skins was that concern when I have cousin who are lighter and red headed then the first rude saleperson.  I will never go alone to a dealership , next time I bring a person who know about car,  and this dealership must stop picking up senior citizen alone and not company with someone who can help them decide which kind of car they interested in, What a nightmare this had become, why I stated a ripple effect because my sis stop buying food for herself and her dogs. I was feeding her but I stop because it not fair that I pay all the bills of the house and she doesn't cook or clean, then she get a new car while I have no car. She was living off me, but I am putting a stop to it, getting burn on both side of the candle isn't funny at all. Life is a struggle and to have people trying to scam you out of your living income is unlawful and down right criminal if you ask me. ",-1

2,2,"The environmental haul away option was very frustrating because there were two options for in-home delivery. Originally I selected the 2-day in home delivery which prompted the environmental haul options to select, but I inadvertently cleared out my cart and had to reselect everything. when I got to the shipping, there was another in-home delivery option for $10 cheaper which would delivery tomorrow so I selected that, however, I couldn't get the environmental haul options to populate again and couldn't figure out why so I cleared out again and tried a few more times only to realize that those options won't populate on the $109 in home delivery option. it only populates on the 119 in home delivery option. if the options include something different, then put that in the description of the item so we can tell which one has a haul option and which one doesn't so we don't waste our time fumbling around looking for that option. The only description difference was that one would deliver tomorrow, and one would deliver in two days.",0
2,2,This is the first time we've ordered plants online since there are several very fine nurseries close by.  But with covid we are trying to avoid in person shopping.

2,2,"When I got a Gettington  catalog I thought the prices were pretty good . That WAS UNTIL I GOT AN ONLINE INVOICE. They had charged me for two futons (I only ordered one ), called the # in the catalog .Was not the number I needed to call to again cancel one of the futons. Also the catalog  stated on the cover that on the first order I was to get $ 25.00 off plus FREE shipping. I had to be connected to another person who then told me that the Futon was not included in this order because it had a ""handling charge"" of $178.00 dollars. So with the price of the futon being $139 and ""handling charges of 179.00"" I am paying more for the handling than the futon. This is ridiculous. plus I can't get an online receipt that says I canceled the futon Or the shipping charges on the other stuff . Now I have to try to get someone one line again that will not have to transfer me to two different places. I guess I was lucky that two out of three telephone contacts spoke English well enough to be understood. Nothing  against these agents but it's bad because of their accent you have to ask them to repeat every thing three or more times. The invoice that was sent on line was the first one that I called to change. I got a feeling that the total bill(the incorrect one) is going to be hard as heck to get it right or not at all possible I would never ever ever again purchase anything from this firm.

3,1,"I learned that NFM will cancel your account for lack
of use even though I have been a member since 1989",-2
3,2,"The salesperson was very nice, but I was given the incorrect shipping price and also given the incorrect delivery date.  I asked for them to address this issue as the entire purchase was more than initially relayed to me.  They did not address it and were not helpful with those issues.  I liked the couch so bought it but I will think twice about shopping at this place again give those issues.",-1
3,2,"The system is fine. The customer support is horrible. You never get the same answer twice, the transfer process to a new owner of the home is a joke, and their responses make no sense. I was charged for another month of monitoring, despite not having access to my account because the transfer was already completed? Our experience since we got the system is that the equipment is fine but their support team is awful.",-1
3,2,I like the furniture. I have many pieces but have had terrible delivery every time.,-1
3,2,never seem to get free shipping. is that a scam?,-1
3,2,"We where welcomed into the showroom and given space to look around without feeling pressured into buying. When we decided on a sofa we wanted, the salesman where very approachable and chatty. 

Getting the finace agreement he Never confirmed (my) name when getting finance arranged(just assumed it was the same as my email address) therefore the wrong name given to finance company, I was never given any terms & conditions to sign but was told I would receive by email within 30mins of leaving shop.

I have spent most of my afternoon on the phone to DFS and the finance company trying to explain what a shambles of an experience we have had just because the man assumed my name was the same as my email address when it was not. Therefore the finance was unable to be accepted because there was no one with that name. Had the salesman been more thorough and done his job properly this was not have happened.",-1
3,2,not really impressed with cite once you check out a product it and go back it takes you  Back to the beginning so it takes too long to look for things,-1
3,2,The app is terrible and seems like anytime I actually need to use it it is unavailable. Cameras don’t have great low light visibility.,-1
3,2,Just received my plants and they were in pretty rough shape. Reserving judgement until they have a chance to recover,-1
3,2,The website is so slow!!,-1
3,2,"Do not like the price. The price kept going up for different ""promotional"" products. I like the cameras; however, you can buy them on Amazon for cheaper. ",-1
3,3,"SINCE MY ORDER WAS NOT DURING A FREE FREIGHT PERIOD & I HAD TO PAY FREIGHT, I CHOSE STANDARD DELIVERY & EVERYTHING SHOWED IN STOCK. THE 1ST PART OF THE ORDER SHIPPED 9/1 WITH AN ETA OF 9/5 -ACCEPTABLE. THE 2ND HALF SHIPPED 9/2 WITH AN ETA OF 9/14- TOTALLY UNACEPTABLE & RIDICULOUS SINCE IT IS COMING FROM KENTUCKY.",0
3,3,Didn't like that there's no way to cancel purchase within 24hr.time frame & then takes too long to receive purchase,0
3,3,Delivery charges are very high!,0
3,3,"When the billing address is different than the shipping address, the user interface is not intuitive on needing to hit update first then continue. Thanks!",0
3,3,"Convenient, yes. Not the same as in person sales experience. And not available to measure or offer dimensions.",0
3,3,"Website is easy to use, however round and smaller sized rug do not render correctly in the room visualizer. They display very small and are not able to be resized.  
Also, coupon code presented during use of room visualizer for 50% off MSRP was not accepted at checkout. ",0
3,3,"The staff in store were amazing, really friendly, knowledgeable and not too pushy. My only gripe is the website - I found it very slow and difficult to update. I wish I'd have gone back to the store to order but I just didn't have the time",0
3,3,Deliver  drivers where nice. But they did not have the slats for my new bed frame. Could not get them delivered the same day. Had to wait till the next day to get them delivered.,0
3,3,So far so good until I couldn’t open my document which was sent to sign it need to contact dfs. Will review again when and if my sofa arrives on time 😁,0
3,3,"I wasn’t expecting such young plants/shoots, the picture on the website depicted more mature plants.  Also, I had to remind the company of their delivery promise on the 27th March as I did not hear back.",0
3,4,"The date and time on the panel is incorrect. Otherwise the work was as expected and satisfactory.
The light on the garage is very good however it stays on night and day. Is this normal?",1
3,4,"Love the furniture, prices are a little steep and delivery charges are high.",1
3,4,Staff very attentive and helpful. Sofa looks great and we bought it but I think it’s a tad misleading to put price tags on sofas that are actually more expensive based on which fabric you choose. Lastly I think a £90 delivery charge is steep especially when competitors can do it for £30!,1
3,4,They were cordial and helpful. Good experience.,1
3,4,"I requested a call back in order to order a sofa. The call back did come, my questions were dealt with in a friendly and professional manner and I was able to place my order. My only reservation I have is that the call back didn't come until 9.30 at night. In my opinion this is not an appropriate time of day to be starting a business call.",1
3,4,"Great system overall! 
When I do have an issue with my system...customer service handles the issue with no problem and makes sure I'm satisfied. Gotta love it! 
Thanks Vivint!",1
3,4,The staff are friendly and approachable. They are very helpful as well. The only thing is that it takes  6-8 weeks waiting time for the furniture to arrive. So I’m still waiting hopefully they will come early tho. ,1
3,4,Very good still waiting to hear back excited about my new sofa,1
3,4,Delivery/set up fee was a big surprise at check-out,1

3,5,"Carlos has come to my home several times. He is VERY professional, pleasant and thorough. He tries his best to locate and resolve the issues",2
4,1,Explanations of size not good and plants were not good shape and they charged shipping. I will never order from here again ,-3
4,1,"I had this system installed about 45 days ago. And it's never worked. The alarm part works, but at least five cameras are out at any given time. I have done all of their reset procedures, and they refuse to send out a technician unless I pay for it. Absolutely the worst service ever.

UPDATE: I have been contacted and they are coming out to take a look. I will update as this progresses.

Update 2: The installer showed up and fixed one camera as the other 2 had started working on their own after 10+ days of not working. He also moved a motion sensor that was blocked by a shelf... to another room that already has a sensor. All this was done while I was on my way home to let them know about the other 2 cameras. They said they would wait at 1:33 pm. I was 15 mins away. They left at 1:44. So now my dining room has 2 motion detectors, and my living room has none. I just want to be done with this company.

Update 3: All is well. Everything works and Vivint has made it all right. I do wish it was easier to get this done, but in the end I am ok.",-3
4,1,Didn’t get email due to misspelled email address,-3
4,1,Costly last minute cancellation of install. Crazy how they wouldn’t give us first appointment. Didn’t care we had flown someone to be there for install. Cost us lots of money and last minute cancellation!,-3

4,1,They sold me my sofa!,-3
4,2,System continually told my by billing address did not match even though its the address defaulted by the site. I would have used my NFM card if the above had worked but got annoyed and used another card,-2
4,2,Very disappointed with the the excessive delivery Charge £129,-2
4,2,Not able to purchase insurance for my order,-2
4,2,There was no price match option during checkout or any information referring to it with options.,-2
4,2,"shipping was perfect, but the plants in coir pots are a year too small. Not prospering since planted",-2
4,2,"They shouldn't charge for the delivery , especially when spend so much money ",-2
4,2,You are a whole company does not communicate amongst each other it’s like they work the shells not with each other I have requested that you guys start working together to keep you company number one instead of down at the bottom too many people have told me that Vivint is not that good I think you can do better I believe in your company do you need to get the opinions of the people back Together before it’s too late,-2
4,2,"I’ve only had this system for a few days, and am still learning it. I have noticed one thing that doesn’t make sense to me.  Every time I open a door, a monotone voice states this.  The voice comes from the control panel at the kitchen/garage door, and can’t be readily heard in the living area where I am 90% of the time.  It wouldn’t be much help with an intruder, so all it really does is annoy me whenever I open a door.  Is there a way to turn this off?",-2
4,2,Your website runs quite slowly,-2
4,2,"the website was too slow, it took too long to process each step when browsing and final steps to checkout.",-2
4,3,Customer service ,-1
4,3,"They make good quality products and ship them quickly. My problem is That they do not  protect the art well in transit. There was a hole in the box my art was packed in and it opened directly onto the art. Luckily, my picture wasn’t damaged but it easily could have been. 

To reiterate - art = great. Packing = needs improvement.",-1
4,3,"Our delivery was fine, however the “wedge” piece has built in lights that were just hanging off the piece.  Driver called it in and set up a service call to have the lights re glued to the wedge. After the drivers left, I was able to sit and test out our new furniture.  Our recliner came in two pieces and was put together here.  The back piece is very crooked so when it reclines it is very awkward and hits both of our backs because how bad it leans to one side.  I called to have the recliner added to the service order for when they are here fixing the lights.  There are also several deep scuffs in the faux leather the service tech will need to address too.  We’ll see if they make this right.

Edit.  2/24/24
Recliner and wedge were both replaced.  Delivery drivers, sales and Management (Dale) were all very nice to deal with. No hassle what so ever.  Very happy with our purchase and for the way our concerns were handled. Definitely would recommend to family and friends.  ",-1
4,3,"Great products, however there is sometimes delayed in the videos when outside of the house. I wish they can offer more incentives to buyout other company’s contracts, I’m still paying for ADTs equipment plus paying Vivint and it’s hurting my pocket. ",-1
4,3,Over all positive experience.  Ordering a little confusing,-1
4,3,"Of the 15 plants I got, 3 were not heathy looking. These were the Cornus Arctic Fire, not worth the price charged. All others were satisfactory",-1
4,3,The gentlemen who delivered my bed did not put my headboard on as they were supposed to. But The Room Place (the salesman actually) worked very hard to get the matter straightened out!!,-1
4,3,The experience was great but 79.00 to deliver one mattress was just to expensive.,-1
4,3,"Mo in the Colchester branch was a nice guy and explained well. 
It adds up quick though so price of sofa isn’t really the price of the sofa. Bough same sofa and extras for about £600 cheaper. It wasn’t in an offer last year either. ",-1

5,1,"We changed Home Security Providers because the BIG national brand:
1. did not arrive for service appointments on the days scheduled
2. did not inform me their service tech communication system was down and did not let me  know - even though they knew. I was informed at the end of the traditional business day. They informed me I had to call them back to reschedule within 24 hours
3. required that I sign a service contract and pay a deposit before they would confirm service appointments.
4. raised monthly fees our obsolete monitoring equipment every chance they could
5. offered no discounts for all of the lost work times when the service team did not arrive for scheduled and ""confirmed"" appointments. 

So, far Vivint has done everything right for the acquisition, installment, and payment of our new Vivint system.  ",-4

10-15-24 -- After letting you know what awful condition the packaged arrived, unbeknown to me, the order was repeated and arrived in good shape.  Not paying the best of attention to the !00% guarantee at the bottom of the page, I realize that event though I did not make the request, Blue Stone Perennials made it good.  So appreciative.
