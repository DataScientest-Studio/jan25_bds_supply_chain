I called them up and it took five days and three more phone calls for them to get back to me, then I had to send them photos to prove what I meant about the legs.

DFS came to inspect them and took pictures of 2&3 seater sofas ,both with damage . DFS then phoned to say that I had agreed that the 2 seater was fine (which was not the case) . They offered a very small compensation amount which was not acceptable,then told me that they would take back the sofa’s but would not replace them with the same ones as the new ones might also arrive damaged!! This has been a fight for 5-6 weeks to get a resolution,which is now that DFS will take the sofa’s back and I will be left with no sofa’s for probably 10-12 weeks until I get new ones(which will not be from DFS).
