Projet_Supply_Chain
==============================

This Project aim is to build a model trained from TrustPilot reviews to predict the rating (number of stars from 1 to 5) from the review's text.

The steps are  as follow : 
    - Scarapping from TrustPilot API from src/features/web_scrapping_api.py
    - EDA from TOBEADDED
    - Machine Learning tests using the notebook notebooks/Machine_Learning/ML
    - Deep Learning tests using the notebook notebooks/Deep_Learning/DL

The project can run on the environment recquired in notebooks/Machine_Learning/ML.

!!! ONLY FOR Deep Learning !!!
A different environment is needed for DL located in notebooks/Deep_Learning/DL
